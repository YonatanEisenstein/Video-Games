# Video-Games

In this project I will analyze datset with some features regarding video games. I will identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This should allow to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. The range of years of the data is 1980 - 2016, But this analysis could easily be implement to data from 2021 or 2026.

the project writen in python. The libraries I used inclued: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and stat. The project includes the follows steps: data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis and Statistical data analysis.
